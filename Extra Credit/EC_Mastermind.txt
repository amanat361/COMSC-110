1. Write mastermind-algorithm.txt using the algorithm template.

2. Write mastermind.cpp from mastermind-algorithm.  Must have input validation, 10 guesses to guess the code and offer the player a chance to play again.  DIFFERENT FROM video, USE PROGRAMMER DEFINED FUNCTIONS APPROPRIATELY.

How to get a zero score for this lab: if you do the algorithm and/or the program the way the video did it and not make use of everything we learned up to and including chapter 8 and do not use our algorithm and program templates appropriately.
