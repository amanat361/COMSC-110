Exercise 9
Due Tuesday by 12:30pm  Points 40  Submitting a file upload  File Types cpp and txt Available Jul 3 at 10:30am - Jul 3 at 12:30pm about 2 hours
1. create threeQuestions-algorithm.txt to use a subprogram that asks the questions returns a boolean (true = user answered question correctly or false = user answered question incorrectly) value and the score is incremented by 1 if the user answered a question correctly.

2. write threeQuestions.cpp from threeQuestions-algorithm.txt.
For example your code will look something like this, but your questions are relative to computer science:
int correct = 0;
if (askQuestion("1st US president", "Washington")) correct++;
if (askQuestion("2nd US president", "Adams")) correct++;
...
cout

For example your program execution will look something like:
1. How many bits in a byte? 8
Correct!

2. What is machine language: a) binary b) decimal c) hexidecimal? b
Incorrect, but a better answer would be binary.

3. What was the original name of the Internet? Arpanet
Correct!

That's 2 correct out of 3 questions asked.

4. What if you start saving a nickel per week? Then each week, simply double the amount saved in the previous week.
So at the end of 1 week, you collect 5 cents, and put it into your piggy bank. (Here's the URL for this
link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggy_Bank.) At 2 weeks, you collect 10 cents allowance, for a total
of 15 cents in the piggy bank. At 3 weeks, you collect 20 cents allowance, for a total of 35 cents in the
piggy bank. And so on.

Create myBillions-algorithm.txt to calculate and output the
number of weeks that it will take to reach a total of one billion dollars or greater. For example, if the
question was how many weeks it would take to total 35 cents or more in the piggy bank, the answer
would be "3 weeks". Output the answer in a full sentence, something like this:
In ?? weeks, I will be a billionaire!
...where ?? is replaced by the integer number of weeks.
Your algorithm must involve calculation, so that you do not simply work out the solution by hand and
put just a output statement in the program.
Also compute how long it would take to become a thousandaire and a millionaire. To do so, you may
want to copy/paste/markup the lines of code that you used for the billionaire calculation, putting the thousandaire version at the top and the billionaire version at the bottom.

5. Write myBillions.cpp from myBillions-algorithm.txt
For example, your program execution will look like:
In {your answer here} weeks, I will be a thousandaire!
In {your answer here} weeks, I will be a millionaire!
In {your answer here} weeks, I will be a billionaire!
thousandaire version at the top and the billionaire version at the bottom.
