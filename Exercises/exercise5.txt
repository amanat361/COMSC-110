Exercise 5
Due Tuesday by 12:30pm  Points 40  Submitting a file upload Available Jun 26 at 9:30am - Jun 26 at 12:30pm about 3 hours
1. Create decl-algorithm.txt :

1a. prompt the user for their lucky number (integer).

1b. prompt the user for their favorite movie (text)

1c. prompt the user for their age (decimal)

1d. prompt the user for their first letter in their name (single character)

1e. output these data values in a sentence with appropriate lablels.

2. write decl.cpp from decl-algorithm.txt

3. Create lighthouse-algorithm.txt with these requirements:  to determine how far away a boat can see a lighthouse at sea. 

3a. Prompt the user to enter the height of the lighthouse, in feet, with any number of decimal digits (for example, 100 or 55.5)
3b. Calculate the distance in miles.

Here's how to calculate distance: distance in miles = square root of: 0.8 times the height in feet
3c. Output the answer with a label and with both the input and output values, like a 100 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away, or

What's the lighthouse height in feet? 100.001

A 100.001 foot tall lighthouse can be seen from 9 miles away

4. Write Lighthouse.cpp from Lighthouse-algorithm.txt.

5. submit the following files:

lighthouse-algorithm.txt

lighthouse.cpp

decl-algorithm.txt

decl.cpp
