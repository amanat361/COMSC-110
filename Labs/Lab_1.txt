2. write a program based only on your completed changeDue1-algorithm.txt using the partially started program changeDue1.cpp

to calculate change due in a transaction using these U.S. bills – no cents:

$1  $2  $5  $10  $20  $50   $100   $500   $1,000   $5,000   $10,000   $100,000

For example, a “cash payment” of $45,000 is made by “tendering” a $100,000 bill. The “change due” is $55,000. It’s “paid out” in five $10,000 bills, and one $5,000 bill.

In another example, a cash payment of $44,999 is made by tendering five $10,000 bills. The change due is $5,001. It’s paid out in one $5,000 bill, and one $1 bill.
