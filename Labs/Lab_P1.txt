1. Write rps1-algorithm.txt to play rock, paper, scissors game. For reference see: www.worldrps.com
The 2-player game will be interactive: human vs. computer!
The game will replay until the human player decides to quit. Human input will be through the
keyboard, entering R or r for rock, P or p for paper, S or s for scissors, or Q or q to quit. Computer
input will be randomly generated (0-rock, 1-paper, 2-scissors).
Add score keeping to the game to track the numbers of computer wins and human wins -- do not
count ties. Output the numbers of computer wins and human wins after all play ends.
play game:
-->>generate a random number between 0 to 2 for computer's choice of rock, paper, or scissors
prompt for userPlay
input userPlay
randomly generate computerPlay
determine winner
output computerPlay and userPlay and who won
if user won, add 1 to userScore, else if computer won, add 1 to computerScore
output computerScore and userScore with appropriate labels
prompt for userPlay
if human wants to quit, then END
-->>repeat

Make sure you have ALL the possible test cases!

2. Write rps1.cpp from rps1-algorithm.txt
In the coding for this game you will use code blocks, loops, and if and/or switch structures. Organizing
code into "code blocks" will prepare you for moving code blocks into functions in future studies.
Functions for:
--introduction (void function)
--computerPlay (value returning function)
--userPlay (value returning function)
--determine winner and keep score (value returning function)


For example:
Welcome to the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. You will be asked to choose either R=rock or P=paper or S=scissors, and the computer will do the same. The winner is determined by Rock wins against Scissors, or Scissors wins against Paper, or Paper wins against Rock. The game winner is the player with the most scores. The best player is the player with the highest overall score.


Choose: [R=rock, P=paper, S=scissors, or Q=quit]: p
Computer: S, Human: P, Computer wins

Choose: [Rock,Paper,Scissors,Quit]: p
Computer:P, Human:P, tie

Choose: [R=rock, P=paper, S=scissors, or Q=quit]: r
Computer: S, Human: R, you win!
Computer wins: 1 Human wins: 1

Choose: [R=rock, P=paper, S=scissors, or Q=quit]: p
Computer: R, Human: P, you win!
Computer wins: 1 Human wins: 2

Choose: [R=rock, P=paper, S=scissors, or Q=quit]: s
Computer: P, Human: S, you win!
Computer wins: 1 Human wins: 3

Choose: [Rock,Paper,Scissors,Quit]: q

Thanks for playing!
