1. Objective
Depending on the capacity in gallons of the fuel tank calculate the range possible with the remaining fuel.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
the fuel tank capacity in gallons
the distance of their last trip
how much fuel used on trip in gallons

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist

Get keyboard input from the user
Calculate the miles/gallon
Multiply capacity by miles to see the range possible with remaining fuel

OUTPUT:
Prompt1 = "What is the fuel tank capacity [in gallons] of your vehicle: "
Prompt2 = "How many miles was your last trip: "
Prompt3 = "How many gallons did you use on that trip: "
Data = "At (mpg) miles per gallon and (capacity) gallons left in your fuel tank, "
Answer = "you can drive (totalDistance) miles on your next trip."

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
[double] capacity = fuel tank capacity in gallons (can be a decimal)
[double] miles = distance of their last trip (can be a decimal)
[double] gallons = amount of fuel used on trip
[double] mpg = miles / gallons (amount of miles that can be traveled per gallon)
[double] totalDistance = mpg * capacity (range possible with the remaining fuel)

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

	What is being tested: A basic scenario
	Input values if any: 21, 200. 10
	Expected results: "At 20 miles per gallon and 11 gallons left in your fuel tank, you can drive 210 miles on your next trip!"
