1. Objective: Find the average height of everyone in the room.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
- Each person's height [height]

PROCESSING:
1. Tell the user what we are going to do (user introduction).
2. Input each person's height and count each person.
3. Calculate the average height and output it.

OUTPUT:
- User introduction
- Label + averageHeight

DATA:
height = each person's height [decimal measured in feet] valid values are 1.79 feet (world's shortest person) to 8.25 feet (world's tallest person).
count = number of people in the room [integer] valid values are >= 0.
sum = sum of all heights [decimal measured in feet].
averageHeight = average height of all the people in the room [decimal].

3. Instructions (recipie)

10 Output user introduction
15 Output prompt "What is a height in feet [1.79-8.25]?"
20 Input each person's height
21 Input validation [see if height is between 1.79 feet and 8.25 feet, can be either decimal or integer]
22 Add 1 to count [which starts at zero]
23 Add height to sum [which starts at zero]
24 More people? If yes - keep going. If no - skip to instruction 30
25 Go back to instruction 15 [looping until no more people]
30 Divide sum by count
40 Output averageHeight

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1:

	What is being tested: 5 people in the room
	Input values (if any): heights 6.5 feet, 5 feet, 6 feet
	Expected results: average height = 5.83 feet

	What would happen:

	"User introduction"
	"What is a height in feet [1.79-8.25]?"
	User: 6.5
	(Input is valid)
	(Count == 0 + 1 == 1)
	(Sum == 0 + 6.5 == 6.5)
	"What is a height in feet [1.79-8.25]?"
	User: 5
	(Input is valid)
	(Count == 1 + 1 == 2)
	(Sum == 6.5 + 5 == 11.5)
	"What is a height in feet [1.79-8.25]?"
	User: 6
	(Input is valid)
	(Count == 2 + 1 == 3)
	(Sum == 11.5 + 6 == 17.5)
	(No more people to count)
	(17.5 / 3 == 5.83)
	"The Average Height is 5.83 Feet"

Test Case #2:

	What is being tested: 0 people in the room
	Input values (if any): n/a
	Expected results: error (can't do instruction 30 as 'count' would be zero and can't divide by zero)

	What would happen:

	"User introduction"
	"What is a height in feet [1.79-8.25]?"
	User: [pushes return as the field is left blank]
	(Input is invalid)

Test Case #3:

	What is being tested: How precise a decimal can be?
	Input values (if any): 5.123456789, 5.987654321
	Expected results: 5.555555555 being the average height
