1. Objective
To calculate how many days old I will be by the due date of this assignment (Sunday June 24th 2018).

2. Requirements

INPUT:
years - the number of years in which I've lived, including my birth year and the current year
leapYears - the number of leap years in my life
daysBeforeBorn - the number of days in my birth year before I was born, including my day of birth
daysRemaining - the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date for this lab, excluding that date

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
Input the 4 programmer-assigned whole number values, daysBeforeBorn, daysRemaining, years, and leapYears
Multiply years by 365 and assign that value to days.
Add value of leap years to days.
Subtract the following from days, the amount of days before birth, and the remaining days in the year after the due date.
Output three lines, one showing your date of birth, one showing the due date, and one with your calculated age in days.

OUTPUT:
dateOfBirth - showing my date of birth
dueDate - showing the due date
days - my calculated age in days

DATA:
years - the number of years in which I've lived, including your birth year and the current year - [integer] - years is unit of measure - initializes at 18 (2018-2001)

leapYears - the number of leap years in my life - [integer] - days is unit of measure - initializes at 4 (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)

daysBeforeBorn - the number of days in my birth year before I was born, including my day of birth - [integer] - days is unit of measure - initializes at 361 (Dec 31st, 2000 - Dec 27th, 2001)

daysRemaining - the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date for this lab, excluding that date - [integer] - days is unit of measure - initializes at 190 as that is the amount of days between 6/24/2018 - 12/31/2019 excluding the due date

dateOfBirth - my date of birth - [string] - will initialize as "DOB: DEC 27TH, 2001" as that is my birth date

dueDate - the due date of this assignment - [string] - will initialize as "DUE: JUN 24TH, 2018" as that is the due date of this assignment

days - the total amount of days I have been alive to be outputted at the end of the program - [integer] - will initialize at zero - unit of measure is days


3. Instructions
10 Set the value days to 0
20 Add to "days" the result of this multiplication: 365 times the number of years in which you've lived
25 Add "leapYears" to "days"
30 Subtract from "days" the number of days in your birth year before you were born
40 Subtract from "days" the number of days remaining in the current year after the due date
50 Output user introduction
60 Output the value of "dateOfBirth" with an appropriate label
70 Output the value of "dueDate" with an appropriate label
80 Output the value of "days" with an appropriate label

4. Test Case

Test Case #1: simplest test case

	What is being tested: My own birthdate (Dec, 27th, 2001)
	Input values if any: 18, 4, 361, 191
	Expected results: "December 27th, 2001", "June 24th, 2018", 6023

	What would happen:
	value days = 0
	days = years * 365 = 18 * 365 = 6570
	days = days + leap years = 6570 + 4 = 6574
	days = days - days before born = 6574 - 361 = 6213
	days = days - days remaining = 6213 - 190 = 6023
	Output: "This program will calculate how many days old you will be by the due date of this assignment."
	Output: "DOB: Thursday, December 27th, 2001."
	Output: "Due: Sunday, June 24th, 2018."
	Output: "Age: 6023 days."
