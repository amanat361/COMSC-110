1. Objective
To use a subprogram that asks the questions returns a boolean value.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
answer - the user's answer to a question

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
Prompt user for question
See if answer is correct
Output approprite response
Output score of user

OUTPUT:
Question1 - "How many bits in a byte? "
Question2 - "What is machine language: a) binary b) decimal c) hexidecimal? "
Question3 - "What was the original name of the Internet? "
correct message - "Correct!"
incorrect message - "Incorrect, but a better answer would be (answer)"
score - the score of the user (out of 3)

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
boolean correct = either true or fallse to see if their answer is correct or not
string answer = the answer from the user
integer score = keeps track of score for the user, can't be more than three and starts at 0
