1. Objective
4 function calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input and gives the result

2. Requirements
INPUT:
first number - the user's first number in the calculation
second number - the user's second number in the calculation
operator - the operator to be used in the calculation

PROCESSING:
Get 2 numbers and operator from user
Calculate the equation
Output the result and ask if they would like to do it again
If yes, loop the program - If no, stop the program

OUTPUT:
Introduction and Instructions - "Please follow the prompts."
Prompt1 - "Please enter first number: "
Prompt2 - "Please enter second number: "
Prompt3 - "Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: "
Result - "(first number) (operator) (second number) = (answer)"
Prompt4 - "Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]: "

DATA:
[double] firstNumber - does not initialize, can be a decimal
[double] secondNumber - does not initialize, can be a decimal
[int] operator - a number that represents the operator, between 1 and 4, whole number, does not initialize
[double] answer - the result of the equation, can be a decimal, does not initialize
[char] continue - either Y or N, and the user inputs this to see if the loop should continue or not

3. Instructions
10 Output user introduction and instructions
20 Output Prompt1
25 Input firstNumber
30 Output Prompt2
35 Input secondNumber
40 Output Prompt3
45 Input operator
46 Check if operator is between 1-4
50 If operator = 1 then go to instruction 50a, 2 = 50b, 3 = 50c, and 4 = 50d
50a answer = firstNumber + secondNumber
50b answer = firstNumber - secondNumber
50c answer = firstNumber * secondNumber
50d answer = firstNumber / secondNumber
60 Output Result
70 Output Prompt4
80 Input continue
90 If continue = "Y" go to instruction 20
100 DONE

4. Test Cases
Test Case#1: the simplest test case

	What is being tested: simple addition
	Input values if any: 2, 3, 1
	What is expected: 5

What would happen:

"Please follow the prompts."
"Please enter first number: 2"
"Please enter second number: 3"
"Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 1"
answer = 2 + 3 = 5
"2 + 3 = 5"
"Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]: N"
*end*

Test Case#1: more complex

	What is being tested: simple division
	Input values if any: 100, 20, 4
	What is expected: 4

What would happen:

"Please follow the prompts."
"Please enter first number: 100"
"Please enter second number: 20"
"Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 4"
answer = 100 / 20 = 4
"100 / 20 = 4"
"Another calculation [Y=yes or N=no]: Y"
"Please enter first number: 100"
"Please enter second number: 12.5"
"Please enter operator [1= addition  2= subtraction  3= multiplcation  4= division]: 4"
answer = 100 / 12.5 = 8
"100 / 12.5 = 8"
*end*
