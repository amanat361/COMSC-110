1. Objective: Find the average age of everyone in the room.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
- each person's age [age]

PROCESSING:
1. Tell the user what we are going to do (user introduction).
2. Input each person's age and count each person.
3. Calculate the average age and output it.

OUTPUT:
- User introduction
- Label + averageAge

DATA:
age = each person's age [integer measured in years] valid values are 0 years to 122 years.
count = number of people in the room [integer] valid values are >= 0.
sum = sum of all ages [integer measured in years].
averageAge = average age of all the people in the room [decimal].

3. Instructions (recipie)

10 Output user introduction
15 Output prompt "What is an age in whole years [0-122]?"
20 Input each person's age
21 Input validation [see if age is between 0-122 and an integer]
22 Add 1 to count
23 Add age to sum
24 More people? If yes - keep going. If no - skip to instruction 30
25 Go back to instruction 15 [looping until no more people]
30 Divide sum by count
40 Output averageAge

4. Test Cases
Test Case #1:
	What is being tested: 3 people in the room
	Input values (if any): ages 21, 32, 43
	Expected results: average age = 32

What would happen:

"User introduction"
"What is an age in whole years [0-122]?"
User: 21
(Input is valid)
(Count of people increases by one == 1)
(Sum == 0 + 21 == 21)
User: 32
(Input is valid)
(Count of people increases by one == 2)
(Sum == 21 + 32 == 53)
User: 43
(Input is valid)
(Count of people increases by one == 3)
(Sum == 53 + 43 == 96)
(No more people to count)
(96 / 3 == 32)
"The Average Age Is 32"

Test Case #2:
	What is being tested: 0 people in the room
	Input values (if any): n/a
	Expected results: error (can't do instruction 30 as 'count' would be zero and can't divide by zero)

What would happen:

"User introduction"
"What is an age in whole years [0-122]?"
User:
(Input is invalid)

Test Case #3:
	What is being tested: 2 people in the room
	Input values (if any): ages 2, 3
	Expected results: average age = 2.5 OR 3 (curious if it would be a decimal or rounded as the inputed variables are integers)
