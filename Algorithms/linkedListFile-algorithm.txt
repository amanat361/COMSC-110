1. Objective
Calculate the average, highest, lowest scores and scores greater than average, using a linked list

2. Requirements
INPUT:
file called "scores.txt"
integer valued on lines of the file

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
read and save the scores to a linked list
calculate the average
count number of scores > average
calculate min and max scores
output results

OUTPUT:
list of scores from file
average score
maximum score
minimum score
scores > avg.

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
[struct] Student = has value of score (the score of the student) and a link
[text] objective = "Calculate average, min, and max, scores and how many > average."
[file input] fin
[integer] nGreater = 0 (number of scores greater than the average)
[integer] count = 0 (the number of scores)
[integer] scoreTotal = 0 (the sum of all of the scores)
[integer] temp (temporary value for inputted score)
[decimal] average (a decimal value holding the average score)
[student] p (a variable to traverse through the linked list)
[student] start = 0 (create an empty linked list)
[integer] minScore = 0 (the lowest score of the list)
[integer] maxScore = 0 (the highest score of the list)
[student] aScore (make a new temporary score each time the loop repeats)

3. Instructions
10 Output user introduction
20 Open text file for input
30 If file is not good (does not exist, corrupt, locked, etc.) quit program
40 If there are no lines left in file, skip to instruction 90
50 make a new score each time the loop repeats as aScore
60 read a score from the file and assign it to temp
70 if temp >= 0 AND temp <= 100
70a the created score = temp
70b link list back to start
70c linked list "start" = aScore
70d count = count + 1
80 go back to instruction 40
90 close input file
100 traverse through linked list, for every value, add that value to the sum
110 average = scoreTotal / count
120 traverse through linked list, for every value, if value > average then nGreater = nGreater + 1
130 traverse through linked list, for every value, if maxScore < value then maxScore = value
140 minScore = maxScore
150 traverse through linked list, for every value, if minScore > value then minScore = value
160 Output "The average of: " count " scores is: " average
170 Output "The highest score is: " maxScore
180 Output "The lowest score is: " minScore
190 Output "The number of scores greater than the average is: " nGreater

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

What is being tested: 5 numbers

Input values if any: scores.txt has five lines with the values: "3, 1, (blank) , 4"

Expected results:
The average of 5 scores is: 2.5
The highest score is: 4
The lowest score is: 1
The number of scores greater than the average is: 2
