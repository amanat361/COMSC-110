1. Objective
Play the card game war between human and computer.

2. Requirements
INPUT:
none (values are randomized)

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
generate a random number from 2-14 to represent a card for the computer
Output the computer's card's value, outputting 2-10 as that value,
but output 11 as Jack, 12 as Queen, 13 as King, and 14 as Ace
generate a random number from 0-3 to represent a card's suit for the computer
Output the computer's card's suit, but output 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs
generate a random number from 2-14 to represent a card for the user
Output the user's card's value, outputting 2-10 as that value,
but output 11 as Jack, 12 as Queen, 13 as King, and 14 as Ace
generate a random number from 0-3 to represent a card's suit for the user
Output the user's card's suit, but output 0 as Spades, 1 as Diamonds, 2 as Hearts, and 3 as Clubs
Determine the winner and output the winner, if tie, go again
See if user would like to play again

OUTPUT:
computer's card number
computer's card suit
example: Computer's card is a 4 of Diamonds
the user's card number
the user's card suit
example: Human's card is a 4 of Clubs
winner - output who on the game, or a tie
example: It's a tie.
play again prompt
example: "Want to play again? [y/n]: "

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
[integer] computerNumber - a random integer between 2-14 representing the computer's card number
[integer] computerSuitNumber - a random integer between 0-3 that represents the computer's suit (spades, diamonds, hearts, clubs)
[string] computerSuitName - a suit either spades diamonds hearts or clubs that is gotten from computerSuitNumber
[integer] userNumber - a random integer between 2-14 representing the user's card number
[integer] userSuitNumber - a random integer between 0-3 that represents the user's suit (spades, diamonds, hearts, clubs)
[string] userSuitName - a suit either spades diamonds hearts or clubs that is gotten from userSuitNumber
[string] winner - the winning message
[string] computerCard - the computer's card as a string
[string userCard - the user's card as a string
[chat] continue - sentinel value to determine if the user wants to continue or not

3. Instructions
10 Output user introduction
20 computerNumber = random number between 2-14
30 computerSuitNumber = random number between 0-3
40 if computerSuitNumber = 0
40a computerSuitName = "Spades"
50 else if computerSuitNumber = 1
50a computerSuitName = "Diamonds"
60 else if computerSuitNumber = 2
60a computerSuitName = "Hearts"
70 else if computerSuitNumber = 3
70a computerSuitName = "Clubs"
80 userNumber = random number between 2-14
90 userSuitNumber = random number between 0-3
100 if userSuitNumber = 0
100a userSuitName = "Spades"
110 else if userSuitNumber = 1
110a userSuitName = "Diamonds"
120 else if userSuitNumber = 2
120a userSuitName = "Hearts"
130 else if userSuitNumber = 3
130a userSuitName = "Clubs"
140 If computerNumber is between 2-10 skip to instruction 150. If not:
140a 11 = Jack, 12 = Queen, 13 = King, 14 = Ace
150 Output computerNumber and computerSuitName
160 If userNumber is between 2-10 skip to instruction 170. If not:
160a 11 = Jack, 12 = Queen, 13 = King, 14 = Ace
170 Output userNumber and userSuitName
180 If the computer's card's value is LESS than the human's card's value, output "Human wins!"
190 else If the computer's card's value is EQUAL TO the human's card's value, output "It's a tie."
200 else If the computer's card's value is GREATER than the human's card's value, output "Computer wins!"
210 Output prompt to play again
220 Input continue
230 If continue = y, go back to instruction 20
240 DONE

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

Expected results:

*Introduction*

Computer's card is a 4 of Diamonds 
Human's card is a 4 of Clubs It's a tie. 

Computer's card is a King of Spades 
Human's card is a Ace of Clubs 
Human wins!
Want to play again? Y

Computer's card is a Jack of Spades
Human's card is a 10 of Clubs
Computer wins!
Want to play again? N

What is happening:

computerNumber = random # between 2-14 = 4
computerSuitNumber = random # between 0-3 = 1
computerSuitName = Diamonds (1 = Diamonds)
userNumber = random # between 2-14 = 4
userSuitNumber = random # between 0-3 = 0
userSuitName = Spades (0 = Spades)
Output "computer's card is a computerNumber (4) of computerSuitName (diamonds)"
Output "useer's card is a userNumber (4) of userSuitName (spades)"
userNumber = computerNumber therefore tie
Output "It's a tie!"
Output prompt to go again - "Want to play again? "
