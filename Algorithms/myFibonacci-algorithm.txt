1. Objective
Calculate a value in the "Fibonacci number" series

2. Requirements
INPUT:
the user inputs the index of the fibonacci sequence
(i.e. if the user inputs 6 the output would be the 6th sequence - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
-----
MAIN
-----
user introduction
prompt user for index
run fibonacci sequence and output each number
output the last number in the sequence
-----
FIBONACCI
-----
If the number is 1 or 0, just output the number
Take the number and sum the values of the two numbers that precede it
Return value to main

OUTPUT:
User introduction
Prompt for fibonacci sequence index - "What is the fibonacci index [0 or greater]: "
The sequence of numbers
The final number at that index with the label (for example - "The Fibonacci number at index 6 is 8"

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
[text] objective = "Calculate a value in the "Fibonacci number" series" (program objective)
[integer] number (the index that the user is inputting)
[integer] i (loop index) Note: this program uses recursion, not iteration for the fibonacci sequence.
^^^ This loop index is ONLY for going through the index to 0, NOT the fibonacci sequence

3. Instructions
-----
MAIN
-----
10 Output user introduction and instructions
20 Output "What is the fibonacci index [0 or greater]: "
30 Input number
40 i = 0
50 if number < i skip to instruction 90
60 Output fibonacci value with value of i passed through
70 i = i + 1
80 go back to instruction 50
90 Output "The fibonacci number at index " number " is " fibonacci value with number passed through
-----
FIBONACCI (an integer function that takes in an integer n as its parameter)
-----
10 if n is 1 or 0, return n
20 else:
30 return (fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)) --- this runs the fibonacci function again with these values


4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

What is being tested: the fibonacci sequence of index 4
Input values if any: 4
Expected results: 0 1 1 2 3
What should happen:
-----
MAIN
-----
10 Output user introduction and instructions
20 Output "What is the fibonacci index [0 or greater]: "
30 Input number
user inputs 4 and presses enter
40 i = 0
50 if number < i skip to instruction 90
4 is not < 0
60 Output fibonacci value with value of i passed through
run the fibonacci function with n = 0 as the value of 0 is passed through
-----
FIBONACCI
-----
n is passed through from main with a value of 0
10 if n is 1 or 0, return n
n (which is 0) is either one or zero
value of 0 is returned so function does not continue
-----
MAIN
-----
60 Output fibonacci value with value of i passed through
as we got from the function, 0 is the value outputted
(sofar what is outputted is "0")
70 i = i + 1
i = 0 + 1
i = 1
80 go back to instruction 50
50 if number < i skip to instruction 90
4 is not < 1
60 Output fibonacci value with value of i passed through
-----
FIBONACCI
-----
n is passed through from main with a value of 1
10 if n is 1 or 0, return n
n (which is 1) is either one or zero
value of 1 is returned so function does not continue
-----
MAIN
-----
60 Output fibonacci value with value of i passed through
as we got from the function, 1 is the value outputted
(sofar what is outputted is "0 1")
70 i = i + 1
i = 1 + 1
i = 2
50 if number < i skip to instruction 90
4 is not < 2
60 Output fibonacci value with value of i passed through
-----
FIBONACCI
-----
n is passed through from main with a value of 2
10 if n is 1 or 0, return n
n (which is 2) it not one or zero
20 else:
30 return (fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2))
this causes recursion to keep on running the fibonacci summing the next two values together and using that as the next value
-----
-----
Main and Fibonacci keep doing this process back and forth until number (4) is not greater than i
This also means the program has run 4 times, i.e. gone through 4 sequences
The console output at this point it "0 1 1 2 3"
Assuming this has gone through all values, instruction 50 says:
50 if number < i skip to instruction 90
now the program can finish with instruction 90
-----
-----
MAIN
-----
90 Output "The fibonacci number at index " number " is " fibonacci value with number passed through
This does the fibonacci functions like above, but instead of passing through i, it passes through number
number is 4, meaning it just calculates the value for the last number in the sequence
"The fibonacci number at index 4 is 3"
