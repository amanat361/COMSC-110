1. Objective: Prompt the user to input 4 numbers between 0 and 100, and calculate the average of those 4 numbers, and how many of those 4 numbers are above the average.

2. Requirements:
--INPUT
4 numbers between 0-100

--PROCESSING
input 4 numbers
calculate the average 
compare each of the 4 numbers to the average to count how many of those 4 numbers are greater than the average
output average
output number of the 4 input numbers are greater than the average

user Instructions: You will be prompted for 4 numbers to get the average and how many of those numbers are above the average.
prompt1: "Please enter a number [0-100]: "
label1: "The average of "
label2: " numbers is "
label3: ".  "
label4: " numbers are greater than the average."


--Data
array-Numbers defined for 4 values-->>stores 4 input values from the user (integer)
average-->>calculated average of 4 values input (decimal)
nGreater-->>calculated number of input values that are greater than the calculated average (integer)
sum-->>sum of input values (integer)
count-->>count input values (integer)
i-->>loop iteration index (integer)

30 output user instructions
***initialize values
40 i = 0

***input loop
90 output prompt1
100 input Numbers[count]
105 if Numbers[count] < 0 OR Numbers[count] > 100 then skip to instruction 90
110 sum = sum + Numbers[count]
120 count = count + 1
130 if count <= 3 then skip to instruction 90
***calculate average
140 if count > 0 then average = sum / count
***calculate the number of input values that are greater than the average
150 if average < Numbers[i] then nGreater = nGreater + 1
160 i = i + 1
170 if i < count then skip to instruction 150
***output results

4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: input values = 64, 94, 94, 94.  Expected results = 86.5 and 3 values are greater than the average.
Output user introduction and instructions
i = 0
count = 0
sum= 0
average = 0
nGreater = 0
output "Please enter a number [0-100]: "
input Numbers[count]
sum = sum + Numbers[count] = 346
count = count + 1 = 4
user enters 64, 94, 94, and 94
Numbers[] = Numbers[] {64,94,94,94}
numbers are valid, continue (between 0-100)
count > 0 so average = sum / count = 346 / 4 = 86.5
if average < Numbers[i] then nGreater = nGreater + 1
nGreater = 3 because 94, 94, and 94 are all above the average of 86.5
Output "The average of 4 numbers is 346. 3 numbers are greater than the average."
