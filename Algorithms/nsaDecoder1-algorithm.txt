1. Objective
Enter a line of text then decode the text to the previous character in the ASCII code

2. Requirements
INPUT:
Input file to encode with text in the file

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
Get file name from user
Open input file (secret.txt)
For each character in the file, bump it down one in the ASCII code (b = a, 2 = 1, @ = ?, etc.)
Output encoded text to the console
Close secret.txt

OUTPUT:
Output user introduction
Output decoded text to the console

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
[string] objective - "Enter a line of text then encode the text to the next character in the ASCII code."
[string] text - text inputted by the user in their text file
[string] input file - the name of the file that is inputted by the user
[integer] loop index - a letter like 'c' to be used in a for loop
[ifstream] fin - a variable to hold the value of an inputted file (reading from a file)

3. Instructions
10 Output user introduction
20 Ask user for name of input file
25 Input name of input file
30 Open file for input
35 Check if file is good
40 If there is no text in the input file, skip to instruction 100
50 Get a line of text from input file
60 For each character in the line of text, move that character ASCII code - 1
70 Output decoded text to the console
80 If EOF skip to instruction 90 else skip to instruction 50
90 Close file

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

	What is being tested: Decoding Ifmmp-!Xpsme"
	Input values if any: secret.txt with Ifmmp-!Xpsme" written on its first line
	Expected results:

Output user introduction
Output: Hello, World!

Test Case #2: specific scenario

	What is being tested: decoding multiple lines
	Input values if any:
	Ifmmp-!Xpsme"
	Ep!nvmujqmf!mjoft!xpsl@
	Expected results:

Output user introduction
Output:
Hello, World!
Do multiple lines work?
