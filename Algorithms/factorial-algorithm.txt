1. Objective
A factorial program that uses iteration

2. Requirements
INPUT:
a number inputted by the user [integer]

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
-----
MAIN
-----
user introduction
prompt for number until user inputs a valid number above or equal to zero
output factorial answer from function with number passed through
-----
FACTORIAL
-----
loop through every number between 1 and number passed from main
if number is not 0, set answer to answer * loop index
return the answer back to main

OUTPUT:
"The factorial of " number " is " answer
error message: ""Input a number to get a factorial for (must be > or = to 0): "

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
<----->
MAIN
<----->
[integer] number (the number inputted by the user to get a factorial from)
<----->
FACTORIAL
<----->
[integer] c (loop index)
[integer] answer = 1 (answer)

3. Instructions
-----
MAIN
-----
10 Output user introduction
20 Output nrompt for number
30 Input number
40 Check if number is greater than or equal to zero
50 if number < 0, outout error message and go back to instruction 20
60 Pass number to factorial function and get result
70 Output "The factorial of !" number " is " answer
-----
FACTORIAL
-----
10 c = 1
20 answer = 1
30 n = number passed from main
40 if n is 0, return n back to main as the answer
50 answer = answer * c
60 c = c + 1
70 if c <= n, go back to instruction 50
80 return answer to main

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

What is being tested: invalid value then correct value
Input values if any: 5
Expected results: "The factorial of !5 is 120"
What would happen:
Input a number to get a factorial for (must be > or = to 0): 5
The factorial of !5 is 120

What is happening:

User introduction is outputted
"Input a number to get a factorial for (must be > or = to 0): "
User inputs -5 as their number
number is < 0
"Your number must be greater than or equal to zero."
"Input a number to get a factorial for (must be > or = to 0): "
User inputs 5 as their number
5 is passed to factorial as n
c = 1
answer = 1
c <= n ----- 1 <= 5
5 != 0
answer = answer * c = 1 * 1 = 1
c = c + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
answer = 1
answer = answer * c = 1 * 2 = 2
c = c + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
answer = 2
answer = answer * c = 2 * 3 = 6
c = c + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
answer = 6
answer = answer * c = 6 * 4 = 24
c = c + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
answer = 24
answer = answer * c = 24 * 5 = 120
c = c + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6
answer = 120
c > n because 6 > 5, loop doesn't continue
return 120 as answer back to main
"The factorial of !5 is 120"
