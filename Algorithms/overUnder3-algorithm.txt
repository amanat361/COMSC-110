1. Objective

2. Requirements
1. guessing 1 and 100
2. input validation
3. check if the user guess has already been guessed and provide feeback "you alread guessed " guess
4. did the user guess the random target number
5. check if the user guess is too high and provide feedback "that's too high---guess again"
6. check if the suer guess is too low and provide feedback "that's too low---guess again"

INPUT:
user's guess - the user must input an integer as their guess

PROCESSING: the objective broken down into major parts, use it as checklist
1. data items
2. user introduction
3. user guess input with input validation
4. check if the user guess is correct, or too high or too low, or is a duplicate guess

OUTPUT:
user introduction
prompt for user guess
error message for input validation
error message for repeats
message if it is too high or too low
message to guess again
message if the user is correct

DATA: data item name, type of data, units of measure, valid values, formatting
integer number = random number out of 10 - randomly generated number
constant integer MAX_GUESSES = 100 - list capacity
integer nGuesses = 0 - initially empty list
integer temp - temporary value that holds the user's guess
integer i - for duplicate loop indexing (to go through all of the values within the list)
inputValid = true - a value that determines if the input is valid (true/false)
objective = "Guess a random number between 1-100" - program objective

3. Instructions
10 Output user introduction
20 Output intro message (different from introduction) "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 10."
30 inputValid = true
40 prompt for user guess
50 input user's guess as temp
60 if temp is not between 1-100 then output "I really want a number between 1 and 100." and set inputValid to false
70 i = 0
80 while i < nGuesses, i = i + 1
90 if temp = userGuess[i] (if temp has been guessed before within the list) then output
90a "You've already guessed " userGuess[i] and then set inputValid to false
100 if input is valid and nGuesses < MAX_GUESSES then set userGuess[nGuesses + 1] to equal temp
100a by doing this, it is adding the guess to the list userGuess
110 if input is valid continue, if not skip to instruction 150
120 if the user guess is correct output "You guessed it!" and skip to instruction 160
130 if the user guess is too low output "That's too low. Try again..."
140 if the user guess is too high output "That's too high. Try again..."
150 go back to instruction 40
160 DONE

4. Test Cases

Test Case #1: simplest test case

What is being tested: the user guessing a number with a few mistakes such as repeating numbers, a number too high, and incorrect guesses
Input values if any: 50, 50, 150, 80, 70, 60, 55, 51, 52, 53
Expected results:

I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 100.
What is your guess [1-100]? 50
That's too low. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 50
You've already guessed 50
What is your guess [1-100]? 150
I really want a number between 1 and 100.
What is your guess [1-100]? 80
That's too high. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 70
That's too high. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 60
That's too high. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 55
That's too high. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 51
That's too low. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 52
That's too low. Try again...
What is your guess [1-100]? 53
You guessed it!

What is happening:

correct guess is set to 53 as a random number between 0 and 100
Prompt 1: "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 100"
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 50
50 is valid between 1-100
50 has not been guessed before
50 does not equal the correct guess of 53
50 is not greater than 53
50 IS less than 53
Output "Your guess is too low. Try again...
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 50
50 is valid between 1-100
50 HAS been guessed before
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 150
50 is NOT valid between 1-100
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 80
80 is valid between 1-100
80 has not been guessed before
80 does not equal the correct guess of 53
80 IS greater than 53
Output "That's too high. Try again..."
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 70
70 is valid between 1-100
70 has not been guessed before
70 does not equal the correct guess of 53
70 IS greater than 53
Output "That's too high. Try again..."
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 60
60 is valid between 1-100
60 has not been guessed before
60 does not equal the correct guess of 53
60 IS greater than 53
Output "That's too high. Try again..."
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 55
55 is valid between 1-100
55 has not been guessed before
55 does not equal the correct guess of 53
55 IS greater than 53
Output "That's too high. Try again..."
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 51
51 is valid between 1-100
51 has not been guessed before
51 does not equal the correct guess of 53
51 is not greater than 53
51 IS less than 51
Output "That's too low. Try again..."
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 52
52 is valid between 1-100
52 has not been guessed before
52 does not equal the correct guess of 53
52 is not greater than 53
52 IS less than 51
Output "That's too low. Try again..."
Prompt for guess: "What is your guess [1-100]?"
Input temp - user inputs 53
53 is valid between 1-100
53 has not been guessed before
53 DOES equal the correct guess of 53
Output "You guessed it!"
